            Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965.
            Gaining a following as a psychedelic pop group, they were
            distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic
            experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and
            became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. Pink Floyd were
            one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with
            influencing genres such as neo-progressive rock and ambient music.

              >. Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to
              visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink
              Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had
              performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These
              compositions became the starting point for a new album whose
              opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by
              Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. While Pink Floyd were working
              on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio.
              Thorgerson recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but
              he wasn't really there". Most of <em> Wish You Were</em> Here
              premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at
              Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both
              the UK and the US

              originated with Waters, loosely based on

                George Orwell</a

              <strong id="bullet-color">1979</strong> - In July 1978, amid a
              financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented
              two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute
              demo with the working title <em>Bricks in the Wall</em>; the other
              later became Waters' first solo album,
              <em> The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</em>. Although both Mason
              and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former. During
              the recording of

                >The Wall</a
              >, the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution
              and fired him. The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single
              since "Money", "Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)", which topped
              the charts in the US and the UK. The Wall was released on 30
              November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15
              weeks, reaching number three in the UK. It is number three on the

              >. The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage
              and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved
              impractical to film. Eventually, it was screened at the Cannes
              Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the
              UK in July 1982.

              Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the
              album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and
              asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some
              songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: "I'm certainly
              guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about
              wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut". Rolling Stone
              magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it "a
              superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece".
              Loder viewed The Final Cut as "essentially a Roger Waters solo
              album".

              - For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal
              pursuits, such as filming and competing in the
              <em>La Carrera Panamericana</em> and recording a soundtrack for a
              film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a
              new album,

              Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising
              material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to
              begin creating songs. Eager to avoid competing against other album
              releases, as had happened with <em>A Momentary Lapse</em>, Pink
              Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would
              resume touring. The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and
              the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart
